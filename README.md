This is simple Android-based app utilizing the openweathermap.org API and Android fragments.

The app is still in "beta" and more functions are being added to it. Currently the Settings(location and units system) are saved in the SharedPreferences. 

Res folder in the GitHub rep has only one Drawables folder. The app itself consists of drawables to account for optimal number of covered devices.
